This program will allow users to encrypt image by adding a key value to each pixel's RGB value, and then decrypt by subtracting the same key value.

First, install the Pillow library if you haven't already by using the command "pip install pillow"

Replace input_image.png with the path to your input image and set the desired key value.
run the script by "run image_encryption.py"

After running the script, you should see three images in the same directory: the original input image, an encrypted image, and a decrypted image. The decrypted image should be identical to the original input image.
